                The testbed includes 16 poles and each pole includes a wide array of sensors(including air quality,
                cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and audio) and networking capabilities(SDR, DSRC, 802.11AC, and 802.11AD)
                shown in Table 1 and 2. Poles and industrial enclosures at each location allow for easy deployment
                of additional application specific hardware.
                <br><br>
                All data generated within the testbed is ingested into a scalable, event-driven, publish/subscribe
                data integration platform. All data is accessible in real-time via APIs that are provided to
                partners.
                Prebuilt connectors can be utilized for continuous integration by popular data storage
                platforms such as HDFS, AWS S3, and Cassandra. These connectors run on our scalable connect cluster
                that can be deployed with no development, only configuration. Our localized data center allows
                low-latency, high-bandwidth connections that are necessary to meet the time critical application
                requirements. It also hosts operational data stores for analysis, reporting, and monitoring before
                the data lands in our data lake.
                <h2 class="ui inverted header">Networking</h2>
                The physical infrastructure is supported by EPB’s gigabit fiber network. This will guarantee high
                throughput and low latency backhaul. In addition, we are working on several wireless technologies
                on the testbed, some are implemented and the rest are being investigated:
                <ol>
                    <li>DSRC: Access points are deployed throughout the testbed resulting in a single network for
                        all devices to operate. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is deployed throughout
                        the testbed to allow high speed communications between vehicles and the roadside units
                        and/or between vehicles with a range of up to 1 km.
                    </li>
                    <li>4G, 5G, mmWave: We are exploiting other technologies to complement the DSRC technology to
                        overcome the fact that DSRC’s throughput and delay performance degrades in large-scale
                        connected autonomous vehicles. More specifically, we are investigating wireless
                        technologies such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and millimeter wave communication by
                        using our testbed to evaluate and assess their performance. These technologies can be added
                        to the testbed for a comprehensive assessment.
                    </li>
                    <li>UWB: Location-based applications highly depend on availability of GPS signal. Mapping
                        applications for vehicle routing usually suffer in highly dense urban areas that GPS signal
                        cannot penetrate due to shadowing. Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology has been proposed for a
                        precise positioning and navigation system. We are working on enhancing our testbed
                        capability by adding UWB transmitters.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                To ensure the security of the wireless communications, we have been working on implementing
                blockchain. Blockchain provides a secure and distributed database for scalable applications. The
                receiving unit can validate the authenticity of the received messages using blockchain database.
                Our testbed has processing units that will enable us to process and update the blocks for our
                distributed database. These edge units on our testbed makes the implementation of blockchain
                possible. We are in the process of investigating the practicality of using blockchain adaptation
                together with DSRC or other wireless communication (5G technologies) to ensure secure data
                transmission for future vehicle to vehicle or infrastructure communication. You can see a list
                of these devices with a simple description below:

                With the testbed's variety of sensors, it is possible to implement a variety of applications that
                easily utilize the data inputs that are obtainable. Many projects have been proposed and a few have
                been deployed using these sensors (such as the PurpleAir and YOLO Counter included on this site).
                These sensors and a basic description are listed below:

                <h2 class="ui inverted header">Edge Computing</h2>

                To distribute processing and further decrease the inherent latency caused by distance, edge
                computing can be used. Edge computing will be used for audio processing using <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/sonyc/"
                    target="_blank">SoNYC</a>, done via Raspberry Pi. An Nvidia Jetson TX2 will ideally be
                implemented for future projects requiring GPU utilization, such as object recognition or image
                processing. The testbed is equipped with these listed Edge Computing devices:
